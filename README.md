## Project Description

This project is a showcase of my Java development skills. It encompasses a range of features and components, demonstrating my ability to build robust applications. While it is still a work in progress, I encourage you to explore and reach out with any questions or feedback at [benjaminisaachines@gmail.com](mailto:benjaminisaachines@gmail.com).

### Features and Components

- **Micro-services:** The project comprises micro-services architecture, showcasing the ability to design and implement modular and scalable components.
- **APIs:** A set of APIs have been developed to enable seamless communication between different parts of the application.
- **API Gateways:** API gateways have been integrated to manage, secure, and optimize API traffic.
- **Built-in Security:** Robust security measures have been implemented to safeguard the application's data and functionality.
- **And More...**: The project encompasses various other aspects of Java development, including database integration, asynchronous processing, and more.

## How-To

### Setting Up Your Local Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- **Text Editor:** I recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), but you can use your preferred text editor.
- **JDK:** I used [OracleJDK 20.0.2](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

For Mac users, you may also need:

- **xCode:** Install [xCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

### Installing Packages

To run the project locally, you'll need to install the following packages:

1. **Docker:** Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. **MongoDB:** Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
3. **MongoDB Compass (Optional):** Install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) if you prefer a GUI for MongoDB.
4. **MySQL:** Install [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
5. **MySQL Workbench (Optional):** Install [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) if you prefer a GUI for MySQL.

### Ensuring Everything is Running

Make sure all the installed tools and databases are running properly before proceeding with the project. You may need to start services or servers, depending on your operating system.

### Configuring Application Properties

Ensure that the configuration in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` files matches your local setup. Specifically, make sure the database credentials (e.g., username and password) match what is stored in your `application.properties` file or adjust the local configuration to match your settings.

For any questions or assistance with setup, please feel free to reach out at [benjaminisaachines@gmail.com](mailto:benjaminisaachines@gmail.com).
